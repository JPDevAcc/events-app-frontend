# events-app-frontend

Frontend for an events app written in React

Core requirements: User login page, ability to view/add/update/delete events

Extensions: Event image and duration, detailed event view, search by event title or location

Post-submission changes: Removed use of Dashboard.js useEffect() due to (possibly harmless) hook error
